Working with Vue.js as the core front-end framework and with Flask for back-end, our project will provide a structured and educational interactive pathway into cybersecurity for young learners. Through a combination of interactive hands-on learning, educational learning modules and challenges, our project will teach students introductory skills in cybersecurity fundamentals, online safety and digital forensics while simultaneously challenging them with practical applications like Wireshark, Nmap and Metasploit. This platform also aims to support teachers and classroom curriculum by aligning with national cybersecurity education standards.
